The Lorenz attractor equations are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z
\end{aligned}
$$

They are governed by this nonlinear system of first-order ODEs. 
The system essentially models atmospheric convection. 
This system unfortunately cannot be solved analytically, so we will be solving it numerically using the Euler method and the RK4 method. 

Defining the variables and constants:

x(t) - The speed at which the air rolls
y(t) - Horizontal temperature difference between ascending and descending fluids
z(t) - How much the temperature profile deviates from the equilibrium

x(t), y(t) and z(t) represent the properties of a fluid layer being heated from below

sigma() - Relates the fluid's kinematic viscosity to its thermal diffusivity
rho() - The temperature difference driving the convection
beta() - Physical dimensions and aspect ratio of the fluid ratio
